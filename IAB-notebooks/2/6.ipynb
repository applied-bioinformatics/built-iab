We'll then run our query sequences through those models to identify the most likely taxonomic origin of each query sequence. Since we know the taxonomic origin of our query sequences in this case, we can evaluate the accuracy of our classifiers by seeing how often they return the known taxonomy assignment. If our training and testing approaches are well-designed, the performance on our tests will inform us of how accurate we can expect our classifier to be on data where the actual taxonomic origin is unknown."

    "We can quantify confidence using an approach called bootstrapping. With a bootstrap approach, we'll get our taxonomy assignment as we did above, but then for some user-specified number of times, we'll create random subsets of V sampled with replacement (DEFINE THIS). We'll then assign taxonomy each random subset of V, and count the number of times the resulting taxonomy assignment is the same that we achieved when assigning taxonomy to V. The count divided by the number of iterations we've chosen to run will be our confidence value. If the assignments are often the same we'll have a high confidence value. If the assignments are often different, we'll have a low confidence value."
